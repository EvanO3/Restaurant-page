# Restaurant-page

# Dynamic Restaurant Homepage
This project is a simple restaurant homepage created using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The purpose of the project is to practice dynamic rendering of web pages using JavaScript, without relying on hard-coded HTML.

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
Run npm run build to build the project using webpack.
Open the dist/index.html file in your browser to view the homepage.
Usage
The homepage consists of three tabs: Home, Menu, and Contact. Each tab displays its own content and can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding tab.

The homepage is built using JavaScript modules, each of which exports a function that creates and appends DOM elements to the page. The tab-switching logic is also implemented in a separate module.

Styling for the homepage is done using a separate CSS file, which can be found in the dist directory.
